## Usage

This repository contains the code in paper "Translucent Image Recoloring through Homography Estimation".

The example directory shows several recoloring results. 

```
refine_code/GUI_hm_dark_style.py.py is the main file.
```

Notice: we are still working on organizing the full code. We will update the codes in this repository soon.

We are also working on a CNN-based method to achieve color transfer. 



## Example results.
